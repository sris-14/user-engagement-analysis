<!-- For Task 3, the goal is to develop a report that analyzes user segmentation based on demographics (e.g., age group) or behavior (e.g., returning vs. new visitors), and then suggest ways to tailor content for these segments. Here's how to approach this task: -->

### 1. **User Segmentation: Demographics and Behavior**

The following demographic and behavioral information from the dataset we have:
- **Age Group**: This is important for understanding what types of content are favored by different age segments.
- **User Type (New vs. Returning)**: This helps identify how loyal or engaged users are and which content encourages them to return.

It can also extend to:
- **Location**: Segment users based on their geographical location to understand regional preferences.
- **Device Type**: Segment users based on the device (Mobile, Desktop, Tablet) they are using to consume the content. This can provide insights into platform preferences and help optimize the user experience.

### 2. **Visualizing Segments**

To understand user behavior better, creating visualizations for the different segments. Here are few ideas:
